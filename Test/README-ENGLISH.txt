BUG RACE
========

The bugs are competing in a race. There two type of bugs. Those facing east (bug_east.txt) and those facing west(bug_west.txt). All bugs run at the same pace. The team (east, west) whose bugs reach the limits of the text file (landscape.txt) first wins.
Which one is the winning team?

Bonus exercise 1
----------------

Print a list, which shows in which order the bugs (east, west) reach the borders.

Bonus exercise 2
----------------

How many bugs of each team reach their goal without running into an obstacle?


Bonus exercise 3
----------------

Create snapshot of reaching the border for each bug.

Bonus exercise 4
----------------

Write a unit test for your code.

Bonus exercise 5
----------------

Now, bugs which are the farthest away from the goal are 10 times as fast compared to the ones which are closest to their goal. Which teams is now the winner?
